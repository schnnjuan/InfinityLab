# Infinity Lab

Infinity Lab is a sci-fi sandbox fusion game where players interact in a futuristic laboratory to discover, combine, and create hundreds (or thousands) of new elements, substances, objects, and phenomena. Using an intuitive drag-and-drop mechanic, players experiment with fusions and chemical reactions ranging from basic elements to complex compounds, with an extra layer of realism in the real chemistry lab mode, simulating scientific reactions based on real data.

The game combines exploration, creativity, education, and fun in an accessible experience for all audiences, with modern interfaces, minimalist sci-fi visuals, and immersive soundscapes.

## 3. Core Mechanics and Systems

### 3.1 Core Fusion System

* **Initial base elements:** Water, Air, Earth, Fire (emoji symbols for intuitiveness)
* **Element creation:** Combine two or more elements to generate new ones (e.g., water + fire = steam)
* **Rules system:** Configurable combination table via JSON/script data, supporting multi-step fusions
* **Feedback:** Visual (particles, animations), audio, and textual feedback for success or failure
* **Combination limit:** Flexible to support hundreds to thousands of created items

### 3.2 Inventory and Management

* Visual inventory interface to view available elements
* Discovery log with filters and search
* Tag and category system for organization (e.g., organic, minerals, gases)
* Option for users to rename elements

### 3.3 Real Chemistry Lab Mode (Core Extension)

* Catalog of real chemical elements (H, C, O, N, P, S, Ca, K, Na, Cl, Mg)
* Real properties: physical states, solubility, pH, energy, chemical bond types
* Mixing system on a workbench with virtual beakers and test tubes
* Reaction validation based on chemical rules (acid-base, precipitation, oxidation)
* Interactive tools: pipettes, stirrers, virtual bunsen, meters (pH, thermometer, scale)
* Safety system: alerts for dangerous mixtures, simulated explosions, neutralization
* Detailed experiment log with formulas, visual results, and progressive unlocking

### 3.4 Missions and Challenges System

* Progressive tutorial missions to teach fusion and chemistry basics
* Free challenges to create specific combinations or solve problems (e.g., neutralize acid)
* Reward system: unlock new elements, tools, and visuals

### 3.5 Progression and Discovery System

* Automatic log of discovered combinations
* Achievements/trophies system
* Progressive unlocking based on scientific advances and achievements

### 3.6 Interface and UX System

* Minimalist main interface with glassmorphism and sci-fi design
* Intuitive drag & drop, supporting touch and mouse
* Modular/adaptable panels (inventory, database, workbench, missions)
* Multilingual system (EN/PT-BR initially)
* Dark theme support and responsive layout

### 3.7 Audio System

* Ambient sci-fi music
* Sound effects for interactions, fusion/reaction success/failure
* Volume and mute controls

---

## 4. Technical Aspects

### 4.1 Framework and Languages

* **Flutter + Flame:** main development for 2D multiplatform, UI, and game logic
* **Dart:** language for all game logic and interface

### 4.2 Data Structure

* **JSON/Hive/SQLite:** for storing elements, reactions, progress, and settings
* Data structures for elements with chemical, visual, and sound properties
* Simple scripting system to add/edit fusion rules without recompiling

### 4.3 Rendering and Animations

* Use of Flame for sprites, animations, and custom particles
* Visual effects for reactions: color change, smoke, fire, bubbles, precipitates

### 4.4 Saving and Loading

* Automatic and manual save of player progress
* Cloud backup (optional, future integration)
* Multiple profile system

### 4.5 Performance and Optimization

* Continuous testing to ensure smoothness on modest mobile devices
* Efficient memory and processing use for effects and logic
* UI and response optimization for a responsive UX

---

* Buttons to access discovery log, settings, tutorial, and lab mode

### 5.2 Lab Workbench

* Virtual table with space for multiple beakers and test tubes
* Lab tools available via menu (pipettes, bunsen, stirrers)
* Digital meters for pH, temperature, weight, and volume
* Visual safety indicators (e.g., dangerous reagent levels)

### 5.3 Discovery Log

* Chronological list of all fusions and reactions performed
* Option to view details and chemical formulas
* Search and filter by category

### 5.4 Hints and Help System

* Contextual hints during experimentation
* Step-by-step tutorial with "learn by playing" mode
* FAQ and educational section about chemistry in the lab
