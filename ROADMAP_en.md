## Future Suggestions and Expansions

### Sandbox Mode — AI and Expandability
- Implement AI to suggest fusions based on player history
- Procedural fusion generation system using vector embeddings
- Modding plugin (JSON/YAML) for users to create new recipes

### Lab Mode — Advanced Chemical Realism
- Import data from open chemical APIs (such as PubChem or ChemSpider)
- Visual effects modeling based on reaction energy (exothermic vs endothermic)
- Add molecular structure panel (ball-and-stick representation)

### Analytics and Balancing
- Internal telemetry system (e.g., most attempted fusions)
- Admin panel for adjusting fusion rates, difficulty, limits

### Online / Multiplayer
- Real-time collaborative lab mode
- Fusion sharing in sandbox mode between users
- Leaderboards for creativity, rare fusions, most complex chemistry

### Education + Certification
- Thematic learning tracks with certificates (organic, inorganic, biochemistry)
- Quiz and test system for simulated reactions
- API for schools and LMS integration

### Internal Editor
- Create a visual editor in-app to modify elements, fusions, and chemical reactions
- Save/export/import custom configurations
